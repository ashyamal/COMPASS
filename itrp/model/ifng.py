Ayers M, Lunceford J, Nebozhyn M, Murphy E, Loboda A, Kaufman DR, Albright A, Cheng JD, Kang SP, Shankaran V, et al: IFN-gamma-related mRNA profile predicts clinical response to PD-1 blockade. J Clin Invest 2017, 127:2930-2940.

Calculation:
After performance of quantile normalization, a log10 transformation was applied, and signature scores were calculated by averaging of the included genes for the IFN-Î³ (6-gene) and expanded immune (18-gene) signatures.
