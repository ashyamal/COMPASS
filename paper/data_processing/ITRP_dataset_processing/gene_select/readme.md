DES: Instead of considering all protein coding genes as candidates for SR partners, we focused on the genes that are covered by the NanoString panel (Table S4) because (i) the gene expression of many of immune checkpoint therapy datasets was quantified by NanoString platform and (ii) NanoString panel is enriched with immune system related genes that are highly relevant to the response to immune checkpoint therapy.
